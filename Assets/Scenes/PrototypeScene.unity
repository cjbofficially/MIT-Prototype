  m_text: "No one remembered the books but her. \nThat was the first sentence in
    The Book of Briars.\PIlya bristled when she first read that line because she
    knew the \u201Cher\u201D mentioned in the passage was not her and felt the line
    had been a nasty, underhanded swipe from the writer at Ilya\u2019s own failing
    memory. It was cruel. But waiting for new pages, waiting to know what would happen
    next, had been even crueler. The writer had not written in nearly two months\u2014a
    still, late, sweltering summer without a single click of a typewriter key from
    the fourth floor. And Ilya desperately needed to know what happened next. But
    the room in the tower of the old, dark house was quiet. The typewriter keys remained
    untapped. So Ilya wandered the dark and waited for more of the book\u2014a book
    through which the writer had promised the truth, the truth she could no longer
    remember. Ilya resented the \u201Cher\u201D from the story, hated her unseen.
    The \u201Cher\u201D who hated the very same memory that Ilya was so desperate
    to recall. Ilya waited for the writer to finish, season after season, longing
    for the appropriate autumn, the one that began the book. The autumn that would
    begin everything.\PThe whole of Ilya\u2019s existence was in service to the writer.
    Tending the home fires, washing the cracked dishes, mopping the creaking floors,
    caring for the caretaker, and caring for herself. It might have all seemed like
    self-preservation, but instead was solely in service to the writer, and the books.
    Not books. Singular, wasn\u2019t it? Book.\PIlya could see the first leaves begin
    their fade to fire from the kitchen window. The thick air of summer was still
    holding on, but autumn\u2019s fingers had begun to wind around the sticky ebbs
    of heat, tugging the late season to other ends of the world. Ilya\u2019s withered
    hands made quick work of the dirty dishes, rinsing them and drying them with
    a rag. She took up the last plate and stopped to look at the half-dissolved pattern
    painted on its chipped surface\u2014purple vines spiraling toward a rose at the
    center. Who used this plate?\PShe couldn\u2019t remember. Was it her? The caretaker?
    Memories were getting harder and harder to hold on to. It wasn\u2019t just her
    age that was slowly eating away at her once-sharp and now failing mind. Memories
    had always been hard to keep here in this place. Ilya opened a cabinet door with
    thin, tapered fingers that were stained at the tips, like a cluster of gray-white
    fountain pens smudged with ink. The cupboards had buckled over the years, some
    had started pulling away from the wall, leaning out and over, as if they were
    falling asleep. She put the dishes away and noticed summer light bleeding in
    through the rotting plaster at the back of the cabinets. The shreds of cobweb
    tucked inside billowed in the air like dress hems. That\u2019s where the memories
    went. Through the cracks, into the gray outside. She watched the gossamer threads
    flutter for a while. A small cup sat dust-covered in the back of the cabinet.
    Porcelain, with a ring of ducklings circling it, eternally following their mother
    duck as she in turn followed them. Had there once been children here? Perhaps
    belonging to the writer? Hadn\u2019t she cared for them, then sent them out over
    the water as they, one by one, grew too big to stay? Yes, there had been children.\PBut
    now the house was quiet. Once grand, it was now a decomposing Victorian monster
    filled with dim corners and shiny-dark floors that peeled off to winding halls
    and countless, cluttered, unused rooms. Rooms with floors that moaned without
    footsteps, where morning fog entered freely and settled into the moth-plucked
    sofas and cracked plaster. It all felt dark, wet, and exposed. If the house hadn\u2019t
    been completely forgotten by the outside world it would\u2019ve long been condemned
    and destroyed. The back wall of the kitchen was almost completely gone and what
    remained was crumbling brick peeking out of plaster like broken bone, covered
    over with hastily hammered-up fence pickets. Vines crept through the slats, coming
    to see what inside was like. What happened to that wall?\PIlya\u2019s fountain
    pen fingers scribbled along the edges of the broken wall like she was worrying
    a scar. Someone had scrawled a message near the broken edge.\P1998\u2014a storm
    passed over the house.\PThat\u2019s right. Screaming wind and stinging rain,
    but also dust and debris. She had written the message herself. A storm had feasted
    on the house, and the house, being far removed, and Ilya, being old even twenty
    years ago if she was right about how much time had passed, had resigned that
    this was how she and the house and the writer would live. There was no choice
    really. One would have an idea or a plan to do something about it, to repair
    it, and this place would take those thoughts of plans, like it did with the past,
    and scatter them in the underbrush, or in the black water beyond the trees.\PUpstairs,
    a typewriter key clicked. Another. Every key struck with labored choice. Ilya
    scurried to the sitting room and listened. A shiver ran through her thin frame,
    a smile in her eyes, disconnected from her grim lips. She decided a fire was
    in order. A fire to celebrate new pages and the end of summer. She fed the mouth
    of a deep and crooked hearth, expertly setting a flame. Ilya could feel the autumn
    chill coming before anyone else. Autumn carried cold, and the ghosts of memories
    lost.\PHer large, round eyes reflected the growing firelight. When she blinked
    back the heat, the lids crept slowly over the wet orbs, dreading the journey
    ahead of them. Her skin was thin, a glazed window hinting at the interior, blue
    veins and bones and thin ribbons of muscle. A beached creature from the deep
    sea. Translucent, alien, weak-looking. But there was hidden, unused strength
    in her long, lean body. The lone contrast to her pale skin were the faded numbers
    etched into her forearm. Marks of a war long gone, but not entirely forgotten.
    She\u2019d been fortified in the depths that eventually bore her here, to this
    house, and she was strong. How did we get here? The caretaker, the writer, and
    me?\PThis was a question she asked herself every day. Ilya slid into a hard,
    wooden chair by the fire, fountain pen fingers intertwined in her lap, and there
    she waited while the writer worked.\PThe light of early evening peeked through
    the windows, casting stretched-out shadows of bare tree limbs, like a trick in
    a carnival haunted house. The writer was spent, having churned out dozens of
    new pages in a fever of productivity. Ilya shut the tower room door behind her
    as quietly as she could, the stack of fresh pages in hand. She shuffled down
    the four flights of stairs, devouring the new work with her orb eyes, finishing
    them by the light of the fire she\u2019d built. When she was done, she held them
    to her chest. Tears rimmed the edges of her lids as she rocked the pages in her
    arms. This autumn. The story, while still unfinished, had been uncurled just
    enough in the new passages that Ilya finally knew what she had to do. Where this
    all was leading. Like kindling, the pages had set a fire in her old, cold body.\PShe
    shuffled the typed pages into a neat stack and took them to the dining room,
    adding them to stacks of other pages on the long, warped table, each chapter
    pinned under a gray stone. The pages she had collected season after season. She
    took a moment, staring down at the rows of stacks, the paper edges rippled from
    age and humidity, fluttering in the ever-present draft. She looked down at the
    book that was slowly being conjured over the course of years, as if she were
    peering over the edge of a cliff\u2014The Book of Briars being born.\PThis autumn.
    Today is the day she would clean the plate, light the fire, and walk to the boat.
    Just like the first chapter always said. She took a breath, then began moving
    stones aside, collecting stacks of pages until she held a chunk of the book in
    her hands. Just the right chapters to begin, to set events in motion.\PIn the
    study, Ilya sat at a small desk and copied an address from a notebook to an envelope,
    then she slathered the corner with old stamps. She slid the pages into the large
    envelope, along with other smaller envelopes, then moved to the front hall, where
    she shrugged on a patched canvas coat. She yanked the jammed front door open
    and marched out against the cool evening.\PThe old gray house stood at the end
    of a small, densely treed island, which itself sat at the heart of a forgotten,
    rock-shored lake. The island\u2019s shape was irregular. Deep, black inlets and
    thick, fingerlike jetties. Paths that once crisscrossed the island had long been
    consumed by plant life and mostly vanished. But Ilya moved along them by instinct,
    muscle memory, pushing through the deep vegetation to the other side of the island.
    The sky was dim and frosted. Autumn. She moved quickly from the ornate, rotting
    house, peeking back to see the pair of leaded windows that had been thrown open
    on the fourth-floor tower until the foliage of the island hid them again.\PIlya
    ducked under a branch, swiping aside a silver necklace that hung from it. The
    trees, bushes, and overgrown paths on the island were littered with old, worn
    artifacts. Scarves and watches, rings and keys, pens and bottles, and mirrors
    and books. The deep green foliage encrusted with gold, silver, and colors both
    deep and long-faded. Most of the objects were brushed aside and piled up at the
    edges of the paths, or into the underbrush, but there were newly arrived trinkets
    that Ilya kicked aside as she moved to the other end of the island with purpose.
    She disregarded the objects as nuisance, not as treasure. It was as if they had
    washed onto the island from places unknown, like sea glass.\PShe approached a
    man at a clearing in the center of the island, on his knees, picking the last
    berries from the throng of tangled, thorn-ridden bushes that stood between them.
    \u201CThe caretaker,\u201D Ilya called him. She couldn\u2019t remember his name.
    Names didn\u2019t matter here. They were the first to go, names, carried over
    the black water, into the fog. The berries were delicate and their skins split
    between the man\u2019s thick, rending fingertips, staining them purple-black.
    Like Ilya\u2019s. But his fingers were blunt and gnarled like the rest of him.
    He stood, wiping his hands on his dark canvas pants. He was broadly built, and
    tall, even though his body was warped as if he were always standing in a narrow
    doorway only he could see. To the unfamiliar he may have seemed disabled, broken.
    Like an old oak that had succumbed to weather or disease. But Ilya knew better.
    She feared the caretaker because she knew his power. She didn\u2019t remember
    how she knew, but a kernel of fear in the back of her mind rattled as she looked
    up at him. Somewhere she imagined that his dense crookedness was caused by rigid,
    angry ropes of muscle that had been held clenched for so long that the pressure
    had turned them to stone.\PHe watched her over the thorn bushes with icy, impatient
    eyes, awaiting instruction. Ilya nodded to him, raised the envelope from under
    her coat. He wiped his hands on his pants and lumbered around the crop of bushes,
    following behind her as she continued across the island, like her towering, crooked
    shadow. He too had waited for the day in early autumn that the book foretold.
    Not because it meant anything to him, but because she had told him what he\u2019d
    have to do when it was time. Where he\u2019d have to go.\PThe bird. Ilya looked
    up and noticed the fat crow sitting in a tree off a ways, hopping from branch
    to branch, following the pair to the edge of the island, its black-bead eyes
    trained on her. Its broken beak clacking as it barked at them in strangely human
    tones. The caretaker picked up a stone from the path and chucked it at the bird,
    barely missing it. Just like the pages told her he would, on the right day.\PThe
    lush greenery and looming trees ended at the gravel and rock-strewn shore that
    surrounded the island. Ilya and the caretaker arrived at a small green boat which
    had been lashed tight around a tree trunk with rope. She could see the far shore
    across the black lake, ensconced in fog. The caretaker waded into the water,
    then slammed one booted foot into the boat. Ilya pulled the envelope out of her
    coat and left it on the boat\u2019s bench, weighing it down with a stone. She
    stepped back onto the shore as the caretaker crouched his crooked frame down
    into the boat and, taking up the oars, began to row away from the island. She
    watched him lurch across the black water, his eyes on her, through the fog, until
    he, the boat, and the chunk of manuscript, had vanished.\PThis was the beginning.
    How it all would start. The Book of Briars told her so.\PShe glanced down, and
    under the water, beyond the reflection of the gray sky and the shadows of gnarled
    branches, Ilya saw the edge of an old wooden sign, half submerged in silt. Its
    ornately carved border barely visible. What was it that the sign said?\PShe saw
    the fat crow watching her from a branch in the water\u2019s mirror. It squawked
    a throaty squawk at her, took off, circled once, then disappeared into the fog
    where the caretaker had vanished.\PIlya pulled her coat tighter around her neck
    and made her way back through the dense woods, to the old gray house. A shiver
    of autumn wind spun across the lake, through the trees, carrying with it what
    smelled like spice and dew. Memories she almost knew. Ilya half remembered something
    she\u2019d forgotten. Only for a moment, before the memory left her and lost
    itself somewhere on the island like an old trinket. The ghost of a memory. The
    sign in the water, how it used to hang from a post at a dock. A dock that had
    buckled in the long-ago storm. She remembered the sign\u2019s forest green letters
    and gold-foil border. And for a moment she remembered the words\u2014welcome
    to neithernor.\P"

  content: "No one remembered the books but her. \nThat was the first sentence in
    The Book of Briars.\PIlya bristled when she first read that line because she
    knew the \u201Cher\u201D mentioned in the passage was not her and felt the line
    had been a nasty, underhanded swipe from the writer at Ilya\u2019s own failing
    memory. It was cruel. But waiting for new pages, waiting to know what would happen
    next, had been even crueler. The writer had not written in nearly two months\u2014a
    still, late, sweltering summer without a single click of a typewriter key from
    the fourth floor. And Ilya desperately needed to know what happened next. But
    the room in the tower of the old, dark house was quiet. The typewriter keys remained
    untapped. So Ilya wandered the dark and waited for more of the book\u2014a book
    through which the writer had promised the truth, the truth she could no longer
    remember. Ilya resented the \u201Cher\u201D from the story, hated her unseen.
    The \u201Cher\u201D who hated the very same memory that Ilya was so desperate
    to recall. Ilya waited for the writer to finish, season after season, longing
    for the appropriate autumn, the one that began the book. The autumn that would
    begin everything.\PThe whole of Ilya\u2019s existence was in service to the writer.
    Tending the home fires, washing the cracked dishes, mopping the creaking floors,
    caring for the caretaker, and caring for herself. It might have all seemed like
    self-preservation, but instead was solely in service to the writer, and the books.
    Not books. Singular, wasn\u2019t it? Book.\PIlya could see the first leaves begin
    their fade to fire from the kitchen window. The thick air of summer was still
    holding on, but autumn\u2019s fingers had begun to wind around the sticky ebbs
    of heat, tugging the late season to other ends of the world. Ilya\u2019s withered
    hands made quick work of the dirty dishes, rinsing them and drying them with
    a rag. She took up the last plate and stopped to look at the half-dissolved pattern
    painted on its chipped surface\u2014purple vines spiraling toward a rose at the
    center. Who used this plate?\PShe couldn\u2019t remember. Was it her? The caretaker?
    Memories were getting harder and harder to hold on to. It wasn\u2019t just her
    age that was slowly eating away at her once-sharp and now failing mind. Memories
    had always been hard to keep here in this place. Ilya opened a cabinet door with
    thin, tapered fingers that were stained at the tips, like a cluster of gray-white
    fountain pens smudged with ink. The cupboards had buckled over the years, some
    had started pulling away from the wall, leaning out and over, as if they were
    falling asleep. She put the dishes away and noticed summer light bleeding in
    through the rotting plaster at the back of the cabinets. The shreds of cobweb
    tucked inside billowed in the air like dress hems. That\u2019s where the memories
    went. Through the cracks, into the gray outside. She watched the gossamer threads
    flutter for a while. A small cup sat dust-covered in the back of the cabinet.
    Porcelain, with a ring of ducklings circling it, eternally following their mother
    duck as she in turn followed them. Had there once been children here? Perhaps
    belonging to the writer? Hadn\u2019t she cared for them, then sent them out over
    the water as they, one by one, grew too big to stay? Yes, there had been children.\PBut
    now the house was quiet. Once grand, it was now a decomposing Victorian monster
    filled with dim corners and shiny-dark floors that peeled off to winding halls
    and countless, cluttered, unused rooms. Rooms with floors that moaned without
    footsteps, where morning fog entered freely and settled into the moth-plucked
    sofas and cracked plaster. It all felt dark, wet, and exposed. If the house hadn\u2019t
    been completely forgotten by the outside world it would\u2019ve long been condemned
    and destroyed. The back wall of the kitchen was almost completely gone and what
    remained was crumbling brick peeking out of plaster like broken bone, covered
    over with hastily hammered-up fence pickets. Vines crept through the slats, coming
    to see what inside was like. What happened to that wall?\PIlya\u2019s fountain
    pen fingers scribbled along the edges of the broken wall like she was worrying
    a scar. Someone had scrawled a message near the broken edge.\P1998\u2014a storm
    passed over the house.\PThat\u2019s right. Screaming wind and stinging rain,
    but also dust and debris. She had written the message herself. A storm had feasted
    on the house, and the house, being far removed, and Ilya, being old even twenty
    years ago if she was right about how much time had passed, had resigned that
    this was how she and the house and the writer would live. There was no choice
    really. One would have an idea or a plan to do something about it, to repair
    it, and this place would take those thoughts of plans, like it did with the past,
    and scatter them in the underbrush, or in the black water beyond the trees.\PUpstairs,
    a typewriter key clicked. Another. Every key struck with labored choice. Ilya
    scurried to the sitting room and listened. A shiver ran through her thin frame,
    a smile in her eyes, disconnected from her grim lips. She decided a fire was
    in order. A fire to celebrate new pages and the end of summer. She fed the mouth
    of a deep and crooked hearth, expertly setting a flame. Ilya could feel the autumn
    chill coming before anyone else. Autumn carried cold, and the ghosts of memories
    lost.\PHer large, round eyes reflected the growing firelight. When she blinked
    back the heat, the lids crept slowly over the wet orbs, dreading the journey
    ahead of them. Her skin was thin, a glazed window hinting at the interior, blue
    veins and bones and thin ribbons of muscle. A beached creature from the deep
    sea. Translucent, alien, weak-looking. But there was hidden, unused strength
    in her long, lean body. The lone contrast to her pale skin were the faded numbers
    etched into her forearm. Marks of a war long gone, but not entirely forgotten.
    She\u2019d been fortified in the depths that eventually bore her here, to this
    house, and she was strong. How did we get here? The caretaker, the writer, and
    me?\PThis was a question she asked herself every day. Ilya slid into a hard,
    wooden chair by the fire, fountain pen fingers intertwined in her lap, and there
    she waited while the writer worked.\PThe light of early evening peeked through
    the windows, casting stretched-out shadows of bare tree limbs, like a trick in
    a carnival haunted house. The writer was spent, having churned out dozens of
    new pages in a fever of productivity. Ilya shut the tower room door behind her
    as quietly as she could, the stack of fresh pages in hand. She shuffled down
    the four flights of stairs, devouring the new work with her orb eyes, finishing
    them by the light of the fire she\u2019d built. When she was done, she held them
    to her chest. Tears rimmed the edges of her lids as she rocked the pages in her
    arms. This autumn. The story, while still unfinished, had been uncurled just
    enough in the new passages that Ilya finally knew what she had to do. Where this
    all was leading. Like kindling, the pages had set a fire in her old, cold body.\PShe
    shuffled the typed pages into a neat stack and took them to the dining room,
    adding them to stacks of other pages on the long, warped table, each chapter
    pinned under a gray stone. The pages she had collected season after season. She
    took a moment, staring down at the rows of stacks, the paper edges rippled from
    age and humidity, fluttering in the ever-present draft. She looked down at the
    book that was slowly being conjured over the course of years, as if she were
    peering over the edge of a cliff\u2014The Book of Briars being born.\PThis autumn.
    Today is the day she would clean the plate, light the fire, and walk to the boat.
    Just like the first chapter always said. She took a breath, then began moving
    stones aside, collecting stacks of pages until she held a chunk of the book in
    her hands. Just the right chapters to begin, to set events in motion.\PIn the
    study, Ilya sat at a small desk and copied an address from a notebook to an envelope,
    then she slathered the corner with old stamps. She slid the pages into the large
    envelope, along with other smaller envelopes, then moved to the front hall, where
    she shrugged on a patched canvas coat. She yanked the jammed front door open
    and marched out against the cool evening.\PThe old gray house stood at the end
    of a small, densely treed island, which itself sat at the heart of a forgotten,
    rock-shored lake. The island\u2019s shape was irregular. Deep, black inlets and
    thick, fingerlike jetties. Paths that once crisscrossed the island had long been
    consumed by plant life and mostly vanished. But Ilya moved along them by instinct,
    muscle memory, pushing through the deep vegetation to the other side of the island.
    The sky was dim and frosted. Autumn. She moved quickly from the ornate, rotting
    house, peeking back to see the pair of leaded windows that had been thrown open
    on the fourth-floor tower until the foliage of the island hid them again.\PIlya
    ducked under a branch, swiping aside a silver necklace that hung from it. The
    trees, bushes, and overgrown paths on the island were littered with old, worn
    artifacts. Scarves and watches, rings and keys, pens and bottles, and mirrors
    and books. The deep green foliage encrusted with gold, silver, and colors both
    deep and long-faded. Most of the objects were brushed aside and piled up at the
    edges of the paths, or into the underbrush, but there were newly arrived trinkets
    that Ilya kicked aside as she moved to the other end of the island with purpose.
    She disregarded the objects as nuisance, not as treasure. It was as if they had
    washed onto the island from places unknown, like sea glass.\PShe approached a
    man at a clearing in the center of the island, on his knees, picking the last
    berries from the throng of tangled, thorn-ridden bushes that stood between them.
    \u201CThe caretaker,\u201D Ilya called him. She couldn\u2019t remember his name.
    Names didn\u2019t matter here. They were the first to go, names, carried over
    the black water, into the fog. The berries were delicate and their skins split
    between the man\u2019s thick, rending fingertips, staining them purple-black.
    Like Ilya\u2019s. But his fingers were blunt and gnarled like the rest of him.
    He stood, wiping his hands on his dark canvas pants. He was broadly built, and
    tall, even though his body was warped as if he were always standing in a narrow
    doorway only he could see. To the unfamiliar he may have seemed disabled, broken.
    Like an old oak that had succumbed to weather or disease. But Ilya knew better.
    She feared the caretaker because she knew his power. She didn\u2019t remember
    how she knew, but a kernel of fear in the back of her mind rattled as she looked
    up at him. Somewhere she imagined that his dense crookedness was caused by rigid,
    angry ropes of muscle that had been held clenched for so long that the pressure
    had turned them to stone.\PHe watched her over the thorn bushes with icy, impatient
    eyes, awaiting instruction. Ilya nodded to him, raised the envelope from under
    her coat. He wiped his hands on his pants and lumbered around the crop of bushes,
    following behind her as she continued across the island, like her towering, crooked
    shadow. He too had waited for the day in early autumn that the book foretold.
    Not because it meant anything to him, but because she had told him what he\u2019d
    have to do when it was time. Where he\u2019d have to go.\PThe bird. Ilya looked
    up and noticed the fat crow sitting in a tree off a ways, hopping from branch
    to branch, following the pair to the edge of the island, its black-bead eyes
    trained on her. Its broken beak clacking as it barked at them in strangely human
    tones. The caretaker picked up a stone from the path and chucked it at the bird,
    barely missing it. Just like the pages told her he would, on the right day.\PThe
    lush greenery and looming trees ended at the gravel and rock-strewn shore that
    surrounded the island. Ilya and the caretaker arrived at a small green boat which
    had been lashed tight around a tree trunk with rope. She could see the far shore
    across the black lake, ensconced in fog. The caretaker waded into the water,
    then slammed one booted foot into the boat. Ilya pulled the envelope out of her
    coat and left it on the boat\u2019s bench, weighing it down with a stone. She
    stepped back onto the shore as the caretaker crouched his crooked frame down
    into the boat and, taking up the oars, began to row away from the island. She
    watched him lurch across the black water, his eyes on her, through the fog, until
    he, the boat, and the chunk of manuscript, had vanished.\PThis was the beginning.
    How it all would start. The Book of Briars told her so.\PShe glanced down, and
    under the water, beyond the reflection of the gray sky and the shadows of gnarled
    branches, Ilya saw the edge of an old wooden sign, half submerged in silt. Its
    ornately carved border barely visible. What was it that the sign said?\PShe saw
    the fat crow watching her from a branch in the water\u2019s mirror. It squawked
    a throaty squawk at her, took off, circled once, then disappeared into the fog
    where the caretaker had vanished.\PIlya pulled her coat tighter around her neck
    and made her way back through the dense woods, to the old gray house. A shiver
    of autumn wind spun across the lake, through the trees, carrying with it what
    smelled like spice and dew. Memories she almost knew. Ilya half remembered something
    she\u2019d forgotten. Only for a moment, before the memory left her and lost
    itself somewhere on the island like an old trinket. The ghost of a memory. The
    sign in the water, how it used to hang from a post at a dock. A dock that had
    buckled in the long-ago storm. She remembered the sign\u2019s forest green letters
    and gold-foil border. And for a moment she remembered the words\u2014welcome
    to neithernor.\P"
